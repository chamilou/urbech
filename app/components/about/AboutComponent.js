        Originally from Dagestan, urbech is a 100% natural paste made of ground
        raw seeds and nuts. There is no thermal treatment of the paste, so it
        retains all the raw goodness of the products. Urbech contains more
        protein than meat and more calcium than dairy. Itâ€™s highly recommended
        for people suffering from diabetes and heart disease. Urbech is also
        absolutely delicious, raw food for vegans and raw foodists. Ingredients:
        ground walnuts (70%), raw honey (30%). Order vegetarian products and raw
        living foods in Eco-Minded vegan online store.
